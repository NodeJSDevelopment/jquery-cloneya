 * Please run all the unit tests by running `grunt` before committing and sending pull requests.

 * If adding or modifying a feature, be sure to update:

  a. the appropriate [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) unit tests in *tests/jquery-cloneya.html*.
  a. the appropriate demo in *demo/index.html*.
  a. the [Wiki](https://github.com/yapapaya/jquery-cloneya/wiki)
